     * Algorithm
     *
     * The space complexity can be reduced to O(1)O(1) by considering two pointers at different speed - a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
     *
     * If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return false in this case.
     *
     * Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing around a circle track.
     * The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner.
     * Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The fast runner is just one step behind the slow runner.
     * In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.
